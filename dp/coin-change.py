#leetcode 322: Coin Change
#Difficulty: Medium
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: list[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf')  else -1

#Time Complexity: O(n*m) where n is amount and m is number of coins
#Space Complexity: O(n)
